## What is Ranked Choice Voting or Instant Runoff Voting

Since nothing in this world is perfect, some of us want one thing and others something else. If there are only two choices then it is easy - you just let people chose one or the other and count votes (unless you are in USA). But if you have more things/candidates to choose from, then you need to make people happy by giving them better choices, and the greatest chance of making people happy is with ranked-choice voting.
